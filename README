# Enhort: Genomic Position Profiling

The rise of high-throughput methods in genomic research greatly expanded our 
knowledge about the functionality of the genome. At the same time, the amount 
of available genomic position data increased massively, e.g., through genome-wide 
profiling of protein binding, virus integration or DNA methylation. 
However, there is no specialized software to investigate integration site profiles 
of virus integration or transcription factor binding sites by correlating the sites 
with the diversity of available genomic annotations.

Here we present Enhort, a user-friendly software tool for relating large sets of 
genomic positions to a variety of annotations. It functions as a statistics based 
genome browser, not focused on a single locus but analyzing many genomic positions 
simultaneously. Enhort provides comprehensive yet easy-to-use methods for statistical 
analysis, visualization, and the adjustment of background models according to 
experimental conditions and scientific questions.
