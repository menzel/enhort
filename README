# Enhort: Genomic Position Profiling

The rise of high-throughput methods in genomic research greatly expanded our 
knowledge about the functionality of the genome. At the same time, the amount 
of available genomic position data increased massively, e.g., through genome-wide 
profiling of protein binding, virus integration or DNA methylation. 
However, there is no specialized software to investigate integration site profiles 
of virus integration or transcription factor binding sites by correlating the sites 
with the diversity of available genomic annotations.

Here we present Enhort, a user-friendly software tool for relating large sets of 
genomic positions to a variety of annotations. It functions as a statistics based 
genome browser, not focused on a single locus but analyzing many genomic positions 
simultaneously. Enhort provides comprehensive yet easy-to-use methods for statistical 
analysis, visualization, and the adjustment of background models according to 
experimental conditions and scientific questions.

# Build

Enhort is build using Maven. Some tests do not work well using mvn and need some files to be set up to work, the build is possible by skipping the test with -DskipTests=true

Enhort works using a backend server and a frontend webserver. Both need to be build and deployed. Additionally Enhort needs a sqlite database for all annotations and a directory containing the .bed files. The current database is uploaded as example.db

A keyfile for encrypted communication needs to be created and the path changed in the BackendConnector Class of the Frontend

The connection ip to connect the Frontend to backend needs to be changed in the BackendConnector as well as the used port.

The backend needs the used genomes as .fa files. The directory needs to be given upon start of the backend as parameter. Example call:

```/usr/bin/java -jar -Xmx60g -XX:StringTableSize=1000003
                    enhort.jar
                    data/dir
                    example.db 
```
